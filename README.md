# Set-up Pihole

The Repository contains a set-up of two Pi-hole container instances with docker.

## Pi-Hole

The [Pi-holeÂ®](https://docs.pi-hole.net) is a DNS sinkhole that protects your devices from unwanted content, without installing any client-side software.

The project can use as an ad blocker for each device on a network. It can also block particular domains for internet access (e.g., known malware, spyware, ransomware,  youth protection, Etc.). 
 
## DNS Providers

The Domain Name System (DNS) finds the internet address of a domain name. PiHole can use as and Domain Name Systems. The users can switch between a bunch of DNS providers. It is also possible to set up to own clients to DNS providers. Some DNS providers use the DNS for their own business, e.g., Google.

## Set-up Environment

## Upgrade PiH-Hole

## Conclusion
- After more than a year of using it, we got less internet advertising, and many internet sides run fast without problems.
- Old internet devices have higher protection against spy and ransomware.
- Some commercial sites and payments services must be unlocked. For users with a high affinity to computer systems, it is no big deal. Ordinary computer users can run into problems.
- The project covers the best practices from more than a year productive environment. 
- Updates with docker-compose are easy and down under five minutes with one script.
